## Projects (Research and Academic)
### COVID-19 Vaccination: Willingness and practice in Bangladesh  
[Publication](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/dpr.12645 )

Mass adult immunization for COVID-19, coupled with the urgency, is challenging for any low- and middle-income country (LMIC) like Bangladesh. Our analysis focuses on demand-side constraints early in the vaccination campaign to help gauge vaccine acceptability and potential contributing factors. Identifying registration and compliance challenges early on will help ensure a seamless immunization program.

### Scanning for Digital Innovation and Opportunities: A Landscape Review of BRAC Bangladesh Programs.
[Report](https://bigd.bracu.ac.bd/publications/scanning-for-digital-innovation-and-opportunities-a-landscape-review-of-brac-bangladesh-programs/)

This report, for the Applied Research and Implementation Initiative (DigiDev), summarizes the status of digitalization, ranging from adopting digital solutions to the challenges faced by the BRAC programs, both in Bangladesh and overseas. the DigiDev research teams at BIGD and BRAC International scanned BRAC’s portfolio for digital innovations through a series of surveys and interviews. They identified 32 digital innovations across areas of Edtec hand Capacity Building, Digital Financial Services (DFS), Digital Management Information Systems (MIS) and data collection tools, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems to manage day-to-day business and Machine Learning (ML) initiatives using Artificial Intelligence (AI) for automated decision-making. Attention needs to be paid to how collaborative and open-source the digital solution is and the security of the data.
